# ☕ Head First Design Patterns - Java

Repository containing **Java implementations** of the main design patterns from the book  
**Head First Design Patterns**.

This project is organized by folders, where each folder represents a design pattern implemented in Java with practical examples.

## 🚀 Implemented Design Patterns

### 1️⃣ Abstract Factory
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2️⃣ Adapter
Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

### 3️⃣ Decorator
Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

### 4️⃣ Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### 5️⃣ Factory
Defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

### 6️⃣ Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.

### 7️⃣ Singleton
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### 8️⃣ Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### 9️⃣ Template Method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm’s structure.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository is for educational purposes and serves as practice to understand:

* SOLID principles
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Software design best practices
* Real-world application of design patterns

---

## 📌 Notes

Each pattern is implemented independently to make learning easier.
It is recommended to review each folder individually and analyze the relationships between classes.
